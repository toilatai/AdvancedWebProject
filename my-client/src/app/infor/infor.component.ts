      question: 'What if my order is a gift?',

      question: 'Do I have to repot my plant once it arrives?', 
      answer: 'It is not necessary to repot your plant immediately. However, if you choose to do so, we recommend waiting at least two weeks for the plant to acclimate to its new environment. Repotting can be beneficial if the plant outgrows its container or if you prefer a different aesthetic. Always ensure the new pot has proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.',

    },
    { 
      question: 'Why does my planter not have a drainage hole?', 
      answer: 'Our planters are designed without drainage holes to protect surfaces from water damage. However, we recommend using a layer of pebbles or stones at the bottom of the pot to create a drainage reservoir, allowing excess water to flow below the roots. Alternatively, you may use an inner plastic pot with drainage to ensure proper plant health.',

      answer: 'Plants are unique and may vary slightly from the images on our website.
